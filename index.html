My skill set is well-rounded, with expertise in striking, wrestling, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, allowing me to dominate in all aspects of the fight. I’m known for my high fight IQ, athleticism, and ability to adapt and innovate in the Octagon. Throughout my career, I’ve been ranked as one of the top pound-for-pound fighters in the world, and I continue to push myself to be the best.
